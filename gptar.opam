synopsis: "GPT headers that are also valid tar headers"
description: """
Marshaling GPT headers such that they are a valid tar archive.
The archive will contain a dummy file named `GPTAR` whose content
is (at least) the GPT header and the partition table entries.
Put a tar-partition at the first available space, and you can
inspect the tar archive using regular tar utilities on the disk
image with the caveat of the added `GPTAR` dummy file."""
